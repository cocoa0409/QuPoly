# QuPoly
an implementation of parameterize binary polynomial system (quartic polynomial system) based on CORE.

First, ignoring all terms related with ( x, y ) and then input the ( t, s ) binary polynomial. QuPoly will discern the form of your target and then follow steps inputing each coefficient binary polynomial of ( x, y ) for basic ( t, s ) terms.

Second, "<(> x )" means the lower bound of x, which is responsible for inputing box region, and "( x <)>" means the upper bound of x, the same goes for y, t and s.
